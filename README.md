# Life_Expectancy_and_GDP
Codecademy Portfolio Project

This Portfolio project was part of Codecademy's Data Scientist Career Path. It was aimed at investigating the correlation between life expectancy at birth (LEAB) and Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The project was left open-ended by Codecademy, but as this has been a "Capstone" project in the past, I used several old prompted questions as a guide. 

The project itself was done with Python 3.0 and Jupyter Notebook. I used the included "all_data.csv" dataset, and utilized Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib in my analysis.
